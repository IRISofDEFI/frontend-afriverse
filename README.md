## üöÄ About Afriverse

Afriverse is a decentralized, pan-African innovation hub designed to empower the continent's youth through Web3 and AI technologies. Our mission is to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 by providing real-world empowerment and real-time opportunities for learning, building, and earning.

The ecosystem is built on several core components:
*   **Learn-to-Earn Models:** Providing education and skills in Web3 and AI, rewarding users for their progress.
*   **TRIP (formerly Tusky Bot):** A powerful Solana-based VolumeBot designed to boost token volume, reward holders, and perform automated trades.
*   **Treasure (formerly AfriGPT):** An AI-powered tool offering insights, analytics, and support for builders in the ecosystem.
*   **Community Building:** Fostering a strong network of innovators, creators, and builders across Africa.
*   **2025 Hackathon Series:** A series of events to spur innovation and showcase talent.
*   **$AFRI Token:** The native utility token that powers the Afriverse economy.

**(This is the perfect section to expand upon using your GitBook information. I can add more details on the vision, tokenomics, and specific roadmap milestones once you provide the content.)**
